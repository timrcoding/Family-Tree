Three, For The Love of Power Trios  - Al Hounds, 1995
...I have noticed that many people believe that no significant trios emerged between Rush in 1978 and Nirvana in 1990. 

However, I believe that what Jess, Erin and Alex did was completely amazing.

When I went to see them at the Kentish Town Forum with Ron (who'd played with Jess of course), the noise coming off the stage was completely overwhelming.

They seemed totally above all the other Shoegaze bands of the moment, possessing a ferocity and power entirely their own.

Of course, it all went terribly wrong, as all Alex's bands do. But while they were around, there were few that could match them.
