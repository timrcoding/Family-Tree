Tom Catz Interview - Bassist Magazine 1992
Interviewer: So Tom, you and Gail have been working together since 1985...

Tom: 1986 actually, Gail was with Sally before then.

I: You were the rhythm section for two of the London scene's most prominent bands, what do you think is the key to your success?

T: Gail and I have always really got on - we read the same books, go to the same political stuff, do a lot together, I think that really helps. We also had great songs, which you need. 
In Alex and Ella respectively, we had the best songwriters you could wish for.

I: What do you think of Alex's work now?

T: I love it, I think he's a genius. Shoegaze whatever you call it-  it's the future of music.

I: Thanks Tom, finally what are you using these days?

T: Same old Rickenbacker 4001. I'm currently using '45s, with one of these new heavy dunlop picks into a Polytone. It makes quite a racket.
