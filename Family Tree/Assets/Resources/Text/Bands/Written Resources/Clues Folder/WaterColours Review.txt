<u>The Watercolours - Stormy Teacups</u>
It's been a strange journey for the Watercolours since the turbulent split of Casta Nyet and the loss of their leader Alex Adam.

Now the surviving members find themselves not only in the throws of a love affair with the mainstream, but also paired up with 
arguably the most talented singer of the current scene.

The result is Stormy Teacups, a collection of up to the minute, stare at your shoes and mumble into your mic jams that are threatening to engulf
indie rock as we know it. Gone is the jangle of the Smiths, The Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen. 
Welcome to flanged guitars, courtesy of Colin Sap, as well as a thunderous modern rock rhythm section.

The songs are throbbing, hypnotic beasts - constantly threatening to break free of Neil's silky purr. This record is sure to set the world on fire.
