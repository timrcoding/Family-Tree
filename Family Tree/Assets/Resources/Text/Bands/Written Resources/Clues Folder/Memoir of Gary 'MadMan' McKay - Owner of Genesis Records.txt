Memoir of Gary 'Madman' McKay, Owner of Genesis Records
<b><u>Chapter 3 - RaRa</u></b>
I was spending the weekend in a part of Glasgow you don't go to, doing things you don't talk about. This was when a mate mentioned his band was playing up at Pharaoh's.
I'd seen Elvin sing when he was a wee lad and thought he was a bit shit really, but things had turned around by the time that his new band came on stage.
I thought Tony was just fantastic, the way he could play was incredible, with earth-shattering fuzz that shook the place. I thought my head was going to come off and signed them on the spot.
Ultimately they were great, but it was too much too soon for them. In particular, I remember Elvin completely losing it after his wife took away his supply of valium just before their gig at the Shepherd's Bush Empire.
Some of the boys, went on to form Easy Tiger, who I managed on the road until things got a little too crazy.
The band wanted to emerge from an enormous chrysalis, with the singer rigged to resemble a 30 foot butterfly.
However, there was an accident with the rigging and Rich nearly lost an eye.
After that, they were pretty much done with the road and so was I.
