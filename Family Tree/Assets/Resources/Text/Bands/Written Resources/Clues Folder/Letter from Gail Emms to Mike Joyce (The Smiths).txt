Letter to Mike Joyce (The Smiths) 1987

Dear Mike,

Thanks again for the loan of the cymbals on Saturday, was a big help.

Tom was loading the van, so he must have left them. Didn't forget his bass though did he. 

Honestly I'm nearly done with this band.

Sorry things are a bit tense with Stephen at the moment. I hear he's made you all go vegan.

I'm not sure I could take eating that many eggs, I'd feel like Cool Hand Luke.

Love the new record and see you at the CND March.

Best Gail.
