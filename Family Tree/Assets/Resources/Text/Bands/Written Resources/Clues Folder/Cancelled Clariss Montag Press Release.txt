"A symphony of loneliness and dejection. Let her finger-picked melodies carry you away on waves of spite" - The Times

"I was transported to a place of utter morbidity". - The Telegraph

"Complete and utter tosh, priveliged white male (and female) bullshit" - Julie Lurchill, NME

Note from Band - I like the last one. Please put it on the inside sleeve of the album.
