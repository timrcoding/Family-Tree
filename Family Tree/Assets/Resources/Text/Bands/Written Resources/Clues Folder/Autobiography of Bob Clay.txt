Feet Of Clay - Autobiography of Bob Clay 1998, p.24
...Don't get me wrong, I loved hitting the skins, but I was always so much more as a musician. 

I used to write a lot and wondered if my songs would ever get played. I soon learned, as long as Elvin was around, that would not be the case.

To me, Ella was a different level of talent all together. I thought she was the most amazing singer I'd ever heard and didn't care who I told.

Working with Tony was a blast, but it was Jess who really sealed the deal- a great player, who locked in with Tony perfectly.

I loved working with Gary on the road, but I did feel a bit sorry for him. Our shows got progressively larger and more ornate, which meant that he was
constantly running around trying to find things like peacock feathers in Reading on a Tuesday morning. In the end he was able to borrow some off
Brian Ferry, who was also in town.

One time Ella had a panic attack backstage because one of the roadies had brought along his baby boa constrictor and it had gotten loose. In the end we found it sleeping
in Ron's flightcase. Later I found out that roadie was actually <i>eaten</i> by his own snake. Funny thing, life.
