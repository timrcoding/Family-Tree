Internal Memo - Genesis records 1986
Hi Richard,

Just seen Elaine, she wants to do something new.
 
Are Tony and Bob still looking for something?
 
Could make a hell of a rhythm section, although I head Bob wants a go on keys now.

Maybe Tony wants to try drums instead?

Kevin S's new band is supporting Casta Nyet at Dingwalls, fooking hell they're loud.Come down?

Thoughts? Gary
