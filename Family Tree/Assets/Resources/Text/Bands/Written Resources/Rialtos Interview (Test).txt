Interview with Alex Adam, Melody Maker June 1985
Interviewer: So Alex, you've been in Tiger Studios for the last three months recording the album, how's it going?
Alex: It's not so great.
I: How's that?
A: Creative differences really. There's been a big falling out over parts. Johnny's gone off in a huff, because I said his guitar playing was always out of time, which didn't go down well.
I: I see, do you think you guys can patch it up?
A: Honestly, I'm not sure. I shouldn't really be saying this, but I'm not sure this is quite where my head is at right now.
I: Do you think you'll make it own on the road?
A: I sure hope so, I need to get my fix of roadside cafe food, know what I mean?
I: I'm not sure I entirely do...what about your spinoff project, is part of the name Russian?
A: Absolutely.
I: Have you been reading Russian Literature like Elvis Costello?
A: No, I prefer Bulgarian personally.
I: How about Sally, what's going on there?
A: Well, we'll have to see, her and Elvin have been spending some time together, honestly, I'm happy for them.
