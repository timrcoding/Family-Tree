Easy Tiger
May 1986 May 1988
Highly sophisticated and sensuos pop music, fronted by a unique singer. The group kept apart from much of the scene and mostly functioned as a slow-moving studio group, due to impracticality of their singer's numerous costume changes in show, and the exhaustion this caused.
